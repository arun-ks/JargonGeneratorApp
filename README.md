# Jargon Generator Android App
Android App to generate Jargons

## Purpose
This is a test project created as part of Coursera Course: ["Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course)"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app/home/welcome).

The application was designed to use multiple "Basic Building Blocks" used in Android applications.

## Development Status

## How it works
The systems relies on a database of commonly used corporate terms/jargons. As these terms flash around on the screen, the used get to randomly pick a combination of the jargons, hopefully generating a unique/never used before combination.

## Mockup
The image shows the UI entities, the interactions & transition between the screens.
